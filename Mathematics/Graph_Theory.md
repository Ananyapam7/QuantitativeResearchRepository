## Theorems

**Important Theorems:**

1. **Euler's Theorem:** Euler's theorem relates the number of vertices, edges, and faces in a planar graph. It states that for any connected planar graph, \(V - E + F = 2\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices, \(E\) is the number of edges, and \(F\) is the number of faces. This theorem is fundamental in understanding the structure of planar graphs.

2. **The Four-Color Theorem:** This theorem states that any map can be colored using only four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions have the same color. This seemingly simple statement has deep mathematical implications and took decades to prove.

3. **Kuratowski's Theorem:** 
A finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to \(K_{3,3}\) or \(K_5\).
