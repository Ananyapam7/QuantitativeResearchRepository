# Papers Shelf

During my Master's, I delved into a plethora of research papers but found it challenging to keep track of them all. That experience was instructive, and I've since recognized the importance of maintaining an organized repository. Now, I consistently review and catalogue academic papers and articles to ensure I have a ready reference. This repository is a testament to that effort:
