# CORDIC Algorithm

The CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm is a widely used algorithm in digital signal processing and numerical computing for efficiently calculating various mathematical functions, such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and hyperbolic functions, as well as vector rotations. It was developed in the 1950s and has found applications in areas such as graphics processing, digital communications, and scientific computing.

The primary idea behind the CORDIC algorithm is to perform a series of elementary operations, typically rotations and/or shifts, to iteratively approximate a desired mathematical function or transformation. It is particularly useful for systems with limited hardware resources, such as early digital computers and embedded systems, as it relies on simple operations like addition, subtraction, and bit-shifting, rather than complex multiplications or divisions.

Here's a simplified overview of how the CORDIC algorithm works:

1. Initialize: Start with an initial set of values for input, output, and an angle (often in radians).

2. Iterative Steps:
   a. Perform a series of iterations, each consisting of a rotation operation and an update of the current angle.
   b. In each iteration, the angle is halved, and the sign of the angle determines the direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise).
   c. The rotation operation is typically implemented as a set of shifts and additions, avoiding multiplications.

3. Repeat the iterative steps until a desired level of accuracy is achieved or until a predetermined number of iterations is reached.

4. The final output is an approximation of the desired function or transformation.

CORDIC can be used to compute various functions, including sine, cosine, tangent, hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, square root, and more. The choice of function depends on the specific application.
