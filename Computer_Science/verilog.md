# Verilog

Verilog is a Hardware description language (HDL).

## Does FPGA have a micrprocessor?

An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) typically does not include a built-in microprocessor or CPU (Central Processing Unit) as an integral part of its hardware fabric. Instead, FPGAs consist of a matrix of configurable logic gates and programmable interconnects, allowing users to create custom digital logic circuits and hardware accelerators tailored to their specific applications.

However, FPGAs can be used in conjunction with external microprocessors or microcontrollers. In many embedded systems, a microprocessor or microcontroller is connected to an FPGA to handle tasks that are better suited for general-purpose processing, such as running an operating system, managing I/O devices, and executing high-level software applications. The FPGA can then be used to offload and accelerate specific computational or hardware-intensive tasks.

This combination of a microprocessor and FPGA is known as a heterogeneous computing platform and is often used in applications that require a balance between general-purpose processing and custom hardware acceleration. The microprocessor handles tasks that require flexibility and programmability, while the FPGA accelerates critical functions that benefit from parallelism and custom logic design.

Some FPGA families also offer SoC (System-on-Chip) variants that integrate an ARM Cortex-A or other microprocessor core alongside the FPGA fabric on the same chip. These FPGA SoCs combine the benefits of FPGA hardware acceleration with the convenience of a microprocessor for certain applications.

In summary, while FPGAs themselves do not include microprocessors by default, they are often used in combination with external microprocessors or integrated with microprocessor cores in FPGA SoCs to create versatile and high-performance computing platforms.
