# Operating Systems

## Interview Questions
### Basics
1. **What is an Operating System?**
    - This is a foundational question to gauge your basic understanding.
  
2. **Explain the difference between process and thread.**
    - Expect to delve into the intricacies of parallelism and concurrency here.

### Memory Management
1. **What is virtual memory?**
    - You might explain how it's like an "illusion" for the CPU and the mathematics behind address translation.
  
2. **Describe the LRU algorithm.**
    - Least Recently Used is classic; maybe discuss its time complexity and how you might improve it.

### Process Management
1. **Explain the different states of a process.**
    - Ready, Running, Waiting, etc. You might need to outline the state transition diagram.

2. **Describe the concept of a deadlock.**
    - Classic problem in OS. Discuss possible solutions like Banker's algorithm.

### File Systems
1. **Explain the difference between FAT32 and NTFS.**
    - Each has its own set of advantages and drawbacks in terms of space efficiency and speed.

2. **How does a journaled file system work?**
    - The idea of atomic transactions might come up here.

### Synchronization
1. **What is a mutex?**
    - How it helps in achieving mutual exclusion in multi-threaded environments.

2. **Describe the producer-consumer problem.**
    - Discuss solutions and their respective trade-offs.

### Security
1. **Explain the concept of a system call and its relevance to OS security.**
    - System calls are the interface between user-level and kernel-level code, making them crucial for security.

2. **What is a buffer overflow attack?**
    - An example where poor memory management can lead to vulnerabilities.

### Advanced Concepts
1. **Explain the concept of microkernels and monolithic kernels.**
    - Could discuss modularity and trade-offs in terms of performance and security.

2. **How does containerization work?**
    - With the rise of Docker and Kubernetes, understanding containerization is increasingly important. Discuss the isolation features and the underlying technology.
