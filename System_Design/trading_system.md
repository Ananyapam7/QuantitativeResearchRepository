# Trading System

- Market Data Application (Step 1)
- Trading Strategy (Step 2)
- Order Entry Application (Step 3)

Stock Exchange publishes a market data event (market data packet), it uses UDP multicast to publish this, so that the market is fair to everyone. TCP is a reliable protocol which is not lightweight.

You cannot go faster than the speed of light. Which is 3.33 ns for 1 meter. Order entry is placed using TCP. It is eventually encapsualted using IP datagram which is layer 3, which will be inside a layer 2 ethernet frame and that inside the layer 1, physical link layer of the wire.

Exchange co location facility. Everyone is equidistant, everyone is given a standard 1m wire.

Light does not travel in a straight line because it is in a zig zag motion

Need to learn about OOPS, C++ and then about design patterns.
